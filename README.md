# California House Price Prediction

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts house prices in California using XGBoost Regressor.

## Overview

This project implements a regression model using the XGBoost algorithm to predict house prices in California. Python programming language was utilized for the implementation, and Google Colab served as the development environment.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the code)
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WarunaDissanayake1234/California_House_Price_Prediction.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload the provided notebook to Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess the data, train the XGBoost Regressor, and predict house prices.

## Files

- `california_house_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the house price prediction model.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises housing features and prices in California. The objective is to predict house prices based on various factors such as location, size, and other parameters.

## Acknowledgments

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Scikit-learn Python in built Library.
